# Copilot Instructions for Learn Intelligence Platform

## Project Overview
This is a learning platform focused on intelligence systems - spanning from system design to prototype development. The project is in early-stage development and will evolve to include AI/ML components, system architecture examples, and prototype implementations.

## Project Structure & Architecture
- **Early-stage repository**: Currently contains foundational setup files
- **Multi-framework support**: The `.gitignore` indicates planned support for various JavaScript/TypeScript frameworks including Next.js, Nuxt.js, Vite, and potentially Vue.js/React applications
- **Development philosophy**: Focus on learning through building - from theoretical system design to practical prototype development

## Technology Stack Expectations
Based on the `.gitignore` configuration, expect:
- **Primary languages**: JavaScript/TypeScript
- **Potential frameworks**: Next.js, Nuxt.js, Vue.js, React, Svelte
- **Build tools**: Vite, Webpack, Parcel
- **Package managers**: npm, yarn (including yarn v3)
- **Documentation**: VitePress, Docusaurus, or VuePress for technical documentation
- **Testing**: Jest, coverage tools
- **Development tools**: ESLint, Stylelint for code quality

## Development Patterns to Follow
- **Learning-first approach**: Code should be educational and well-documented
- **Prototype-driven development**: Focus on creating working examples rather than production-ready code
- **System design integration**: Connect theoretical concepts with practical implementations
- **Progressive complexity**: Start with simple examples and build toward more sophisticated systems

## Key Directories (Planned)
When adding content, consider these likely organizational patterns:
- `/docs` or `/documentation` - System design documents and learning materials
- `/examples` or `/prototypes` - Working code examples
- `/components` - Reusable UI/system components
- `/systems` - Different system architecture implementations
- `/learning-paths` - Structured learning content

## Development Workflow
- **Environment setup**: Use modern Node.js with TypeScript support
- **Documentation**: Include inline comments explaining design decisions and learning objectives
- **Examples**: Each prototype should include a README explaining the system design concepts it demonstrates
- **Iteration**: Expect frequent refactoring as the learning platform evolves

## AI/ML Integration Expectations
Given the "intelligence platform" focus:
- **Model integration**: Prepare for AI/ML model implementations
- **Data processing**: Include data pipeline examples
- **API design**: RESTful and potentially GraphQL APIs for intelligent services
- **Performance monitoring**: Tools for tracking system performance and learning metrics

## Contributing Guidelines
- **Educational value**: Every addition should serve the learning mission
- **Clear documentation**: Explain not just "what" but "why" and "how"
- **Practical examples**: Include working code that demonstrates concepts
- **Progressive disclosure**: Build complexity gradually across examples
